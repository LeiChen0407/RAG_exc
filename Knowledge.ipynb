    "##### RAG弊端\n",
    "- 传统 RAG 的信息检索是基于独立的文档进行的，这意味着它忽略了信息之间的全局关系和上下文。这会导致生成的文本缺乏深层次的关联性和一致性，尤其在涉及复杂关系推理的任务中效果不佳。（全局问题跟局部片段之间的匹配太低）\n",
    "- chunk太大容易漏掉细节，chunk太小容易失去语义之间的联系\n",
    "\n",
    "##### graphRAG\n",
    "- 使用LLM对Chunk:\n",
    "  - 1.识别实体，例如人、物体、事件等（点）,注意，实体要根据具体的文档，进行具体设置。\n",
    "  - 2.识别实体之间的关系。（边）\n",
    "  - 3.并生成每个实体之间的简要描述。（权重）\n",
    "  - 4.定义一定的大模型输出格式例如：实体1：类型，实体2：类型；实体1->关系1->实体2：关系描述，实体2->关系2->实体3：关系描述，诸如此。 \n",
    "    - 关系描述，会有一定的总结的意思。\n",
    "  - 完成上述操作成为LPG。\n",
    "  - 5.构建完成后，将图又输入给LLM，让其检查是否还有遗漏不足，反复如此，直到LLM认为完美了。该过程称为（Data Gleaning）。\n",
    "  - 6.将相同的实体进行合并（构建全局语义信息）。\n",
    "  - 7.在步骤6实体合并的同时，实体之间的关系以及每个实体之间的描述也会进行合并。\n",
    "  - 8.将实体之间的关系的合并和每个实体之间的描述的合并，发送给LLM，让LLM进行总结描述，将该描述作为最终的关系和关系的描述。合并之后就形成了一个完整的文档级别的知识图谱。（图） >> 底层\n",
    "- 如果文档足够大，将会形成一个非常大的文档级别的知识图谱  >> 底层\n",
    "  - 可以将该知识图谱再次进行总结合并：即将过于复杂的子图（那么怎么才算复杂呢，使用莱顿社区检测方法），将其的实体、实体之间的关系和实体之间的描述，再次发送给LLM，让LLM再次进行总结描述，形成更加抽象的图，循环往复（再次进行总结描述，得到层级2，层级3等等，层级越高信息越抽象），直到不复杂\n",
    "- 然后将实体、实体之间的关系和实体之间的简要描述作为一个chunk，进行embedding,存入向量数据库\n",
    "- 然后将用户的输入进行embedding，进行向量相似度匹配，两种匹配方式：\n",
    "  - 1.local_search:从底层进行匹配,检索到相关的实体、实体之间的关系和每个实体之间的描述，然后层层往上寻找相关信息，将找到的所有信息连同用户的输入一起发送给LLM\n",
    "  - 2.global_search:从最高层进行匹配，层层往下追溯相关信息\n",
    "- 弊端\n",
    "  - 几乎每个步骤都让LLM参与了，非常消耗token"
